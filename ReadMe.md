Project Description: This is a basic web application using Spring Boot and Maven to create a few web pages. 
                        It contains a simple index file that acts as a homepage which can be accessed at http://localhost:8080,
                        and has a routed about page that can be accessed via the web address http://localhost:8080/about

Running the site: To run the site, click the run button on your IDE. 
                    Alternatively you may run the site by entering java -jar target/ZBLab01-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar in a terminal window while in 
                    the project folder. Finally, you may also run it by navigating to the target folder within the project, and double-clicking the 
                    ZBLab01-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar file. It will run in the background, and to close it you will need to go to your task manager and close the
                    Java(TM) Platform SE binary program, so this method is not recommended. 
                    After the site is running, simply go to your web browser and enter either http://localhost:8080, or http://localhost:8080/about
                    to view their respective pages.
